"""Experimental TRT-LLM-aligned custom ops for SID-GR Inference.

This package follows the TokenSpeed-style dependency shape: importing it
registers PyTorch custom ops without taking over the inference runtime.

The first implementation is a reference op for the Qwen3 fused Q/K RMSNorm +
RoPE boundary. It is intentionally gated by backend selection before use; the
native CUDA implementation can replace this registration surface later.
